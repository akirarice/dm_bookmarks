# Bookmark Manager and Meta web browser launcher  

-Bookmarker takes what's in the clipboard and adds to bookmark files in ~/.local/bin/bookmarks. This folder as an env variable in my startup.  
-Unbookmarker removes bookmark based on input  
-Bookmarksurf launches a website based on input. You can also choose 'Search' to pick between search engines and launch your browser with that search. Additionally, I have added the ability to switch browsers to launch with. I added this because sometimes I want to use a full browser like Brave, but usually I'm using surf. Script works with Firefox/Chrome varients, surf, and vimb. Probably works with any browser that takes in text for web launch.
